## WHAT IS GALAXY?

Galaxy is a web platform for bioinformatics analysis

The Galaxy interface consists of Three main parts:

1. Available tools on the left
2. Analysis history on the right
3. A central panel used for running analyses and viewing output

From the history, which keeps track of all tools and parameters one can use to analyse data, a **workflow** is generated.

The workflow contains the dtasets and the pipeline of operations used for data analysis.
This can be applied to a different dataset by just changing the input.

## HOW CAN ONE UPLOAD DATA?

Data can be imported via links or from the data library
